This directory provides a way to run a local hdfs filesystem
for use by xframes unit tests.

The scripts present here run an HDFS docker, which is built and stored on dockerhub.
The docker is pre-loaded with hdfs data that the tests depend on.

Use the scripts to run the docker, and wait until it has fully started.
Then run the hdfstests.
